### Capstone Rubric

```python
capstone_rubric = {
    "Technical Implementation": {
        "weight": 40,
        "criteria": [
            "System architecture",
            "Code quality",
            "Integration completeness"
        ]
    },
    "Documentation": {
        "weight": 20,
        "criteria": [
            "README clarity",
            "API documentation",
            "Setup instructions"
        ]
    },
    "Demonstration": {
        "weight": 25,
        "criteria": [
            "Working demo",
            "Edge case handling",
            "Performance metrics"
        ]
    },
    "Presentation": {
        "weight": 15,
        "criteria": [
            "Clear explanation",
            "Technical depth",
            "Q&A handling"
        ]
    }
}

total = sum(c["weight"] for c in capstone_rubric.values())
print(f"Total weight: {total}%")  # 100%
```

### Timeline

| Week | Milestone | Deliverable |
|------|-----------|-------------|
| 10 | Proposal | 1-page project description |
| 12 | Progress | Working prototype demo |
| 13 | Final | Complete system + presentation |
